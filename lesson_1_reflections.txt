How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
the difference in file was highlighted with + sign
in the new file and if anything changed it had - sign
on the old file.
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file
make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
If we want the previous versions
we can take use it easily in our project using
version control.
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit,
 like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
 It prevents unnecessary history of changes made like typos
 the pros is if you forget to save in between and you
 might lose some changes which you can avoid.
 Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving
  multiple files in one commit, while others,
  like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
  This could help see how one change in a file affects the other file changes
  it helps to track the dependant changes in multiple files.
  How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
  git log shows the commit ids and our change names
  git diff oldfile newfile shows the changed lines.
How might using version control make you more confident to
make changes that could break something?
I can make changes comfortable and I can undo changes whenever
it is not working.
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I hate the instructor. the color is not added in my Terminal.
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin"
to fix your changed files
